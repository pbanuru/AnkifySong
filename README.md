# AnkifySong
Convert a song to an Anki Deck by providing timestamps and a YouTube URL.
This is primarily for the purpose of learning lyrics rather than learning word by word.

Uses https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover/blob/develop/README.md.
Please follow setup instructions.

## Tools Possibly needed: still narrowing down.
